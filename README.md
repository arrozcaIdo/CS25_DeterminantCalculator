# Determinant Calculator | BSCS 2-5

This tool calculates the determinant of square matrices of sizes 2 × 2 up to 10 × 10. It also determines whether the matrix is singular or non-singular.

This project was created as a final requirement for MATH 206.


## HOW TO USE

1. Open the Determinant Calculator using the provided link.

2. Enter the desired matrix dimension (n × n, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10) in the input box.

3. Click Generate Matrix.

4. Fill in all matrix values.

5. Click Calculate to compute the determinant.

6. Click Reset to generate another matrix.
